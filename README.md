# Forged Godot Addons

A collection of useful pre-made 2D addons for Godot.

## Forged Addons

- *Fake Perspective*: a pseudo-3d top-down-ish addon, with rotatable lands and entities.
- *Snap Path*: a helper to snap nodes to each other after a certain distance, primarily to create artsy walking animations.
- *Utils*: a collection of generic useful nodes, including NodeLine2D, random utils, etc.

## Project Status

These addons are still a WIP, and no documentation is currently available. This was primarily created for my own personal projects, but others are free to use it. Hopefully once it gets to a more stable state, and I have made some games with it, I can get some "Getting Started" guide going.
